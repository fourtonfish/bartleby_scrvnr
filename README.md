> I am a rather elderly man. The nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought somewhat singular set of men, of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written:â€”I mean the law-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them, professionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers histories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental souls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of.
